# COVID-19 Intensity Map

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive web application that visualizes COVID-19 intensity across different regions using a color-coded map. Regions with a higher number of cases are shown in darker shades of red, while those with fewer cases are shown in lighter red. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and fetches real-time data from a public COVID-19 API.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:** Updates the color intensity on the map based on current data from a COVID-19 API.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website is accessible on various devices, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Interactive Map:** Users can hover or click on different regions to get more detailed information about COVID-19 cases.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structures the web content.
- **CSS:** Styles the visual elements and manages the layout.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and handles API requests.
- **Public COVID-19 API:** Provides real-time data on COVID-19 cases by region.
